this script uses an NTP client to pull time requests determine weather or not an led should be on, I use this for running the lighting for one of my emclosures.
this code is open source and may be used or changed in any way that a person may like. though I'd like to be mentioned in development if you have the afterthought to do so!

I'm Eleri Leigh and I'd barely consider myself a programmer, my knowledge base is more in 3d modeling and other nonsensical skills. please let me know if there are any major changes I should make!

in order to get this working you must install the ntp client by Travis CL found here

https://travis-ci.org/arduino-libraries/NTPClient

as it was the base for this entire project and built from the ground up. the rest of the libraries should be basic arduino libraries if not I'll update it later!
